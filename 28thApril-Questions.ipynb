    "1.What the strength of the linear regression line gives you from the graph.\n",
    "Ans: It tells about strength and the correlation between two features.\n",
    "2.What happen when higher variations in data in Linear Regression.\n",
    "Ans: One of the intuition that y=mx+c is that if the m-value is slightly higher it tells us how strong the relationship,the strength of y and x.If C value is high then it tells about how much variance happen in the data  \n",
    "3.How to do features inter-correlate to each other when they are more number of columns present in data.\n",
    "Ans: 1.Correlation between variables 2.Less bias better slope.\n",
    "4.Different types of bias in Machine Learning\n",
    "1. Data bias- A bias w.r.t to single data (one column) is known as data bias\n",
    "2. Model bias- A bias w.r.t to line(c-value) is known as Model bias as it include both the columns \n",
    "3. Distribution bias.\n",
    "5. do you want the correlation between independent varible must be high or less its a stragery that we must drop the column which high correlation.\n",
    "Ans:0.3 to 0.7 subjective \n",
    "    0.7>highly correlated\n",
    "    0.3< not highly correlated\n"
